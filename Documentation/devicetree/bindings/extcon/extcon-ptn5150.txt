* PTN5150 CC (Configuration Channel) Logic device

PTN5150 is a small thin low power CC logic chip supporting the USB Type-C
connector application with CC control logic detection and indication functions.
It is interfaced to the host controller using an I2C interface.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "nxp,ptn5150"
- reg: specifies the I2C slave address of the device
- int-gpio: should contain a phandle and GPIO specifier for the GPIO pin
	connected to the PTN5150's INTB pin.
- vbus-gpio: should contain a phandle and GPIO specifier for the GPIO pin which
	is used to control VBUS.
- pinctrl-names : a pinctrl state named "default" must be defined.
- pinctrl-0 : phandle referencing pin configuration of interrupt and vbus
	control.
- irq-is-id-quirk: The PTN5150 has an open drain output, ID, that is driven low when a
      UFP is attached. ID is pulled high by an external resistor when either
      1) no cable is attached or 2) a DFP is attached.

      For designs that do not connect the PTN5150 IRQ, this boolean allows
      using the ID output as an IRQ by triggering on falling and rising edges.

      A falling edge indicates a UFP is attached (e.g. flash drive). Change
      to host mode using usb_role_switch_set_role.

      A rising edge indicates the UFP is removed. Prepare for when a DFP
      is connected by changing to device mode using usb_role_switch_set_role.

      This is useful because it allows a single device tree to support
      the following:

      Variscite's Symphony board <= 1.4 connects the PTN5150 IRQ pin to
      a GPIO on the SoM. Starting in Symphony board >= 1.4a, to allow
      compatibility with all Variscite i.MX8 SoMs, PTN5150 ID pin is
      instead connected to the same GPIO on the SoM.

Example:
	ptn5150@1d {
		compatible = "nxp,ptn5150";
		reg = <0x1d>;
		int-gpio = <&msmgpio 78 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		vbus-gpio = <&msmgpio 148 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&ptn5150_default>;
		status = "okay";
	};
